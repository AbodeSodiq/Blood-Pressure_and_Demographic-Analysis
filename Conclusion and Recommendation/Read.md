## Conclusion and Recommendation

### Conclusions:

* Approximately 1 in 4 employees seeking medical care at the in-plant clinic were diagnosed with hypertension, highlighting a significant health concern within the workforce.  
    
* Employees aged 35 to 55 show a higher incidence of hypertension, indicating that middle-aged employees are at greater risk.  
    
* Junior staff are the most frequent users of clinic services, followed by third-party employees. Senior staff have the lowest attendance, possibly due to fewer health issues or less time available for clinic visits.  
    
* There is a notable increase in clinic visits from August to January, suggesting seasonal or work-related factors may contribute to this pattern.

### Recommendations:

1. **Implement a Workplace Hypertension Management Program:** Establish regular screenings and educational sessions focused on blood pressure management, diet, exercise, and stress reduction. This could reduce health risks and improve productivity.  
     
2. **Promote Preventive Health Programs for Middle-Aged Employees:** Target employees aged 35-55 with tailored wellness programs, including lifestyle counseling, health screenings, and resources on managing chronic conditions. This can help address the age-related increase in hypertension.  
     
3. **Increase Accessibility and Awareness for Senior Staff:** Encourage senior staff attendance by scheduling convenient clinic hours and promoting the importance of routine check-ups. Offering executive health packages could also incentivize more frequent clinic visits among senior employees.  
     
4. **Analyze Seasonal Patterns to Adjust Staffing and Resources:** Support clinic staff and resources during these months. Understanding the causes of seasonal spikes could also help design targeted health campaigns.  
     
5. **Address Work-Related Health Risks for Junior and Third-Party Employees:** Conduct a workplace health assessment to identify potential stressors or health risks affecting junior and third-party staff. Offer support through workshops on stress management, ergonomic adjustments, and access to mental health resources to foster a healthier work environment.
